                        <h4>5 Steps For Giving De-Wormer To Horses</h4>
                    </div>
                    <div className="sectionInfoDivParent">
                        <div className="sectionInfoDiv">
                            <p>I have found that most people's horses resist taking de-wormer because they usually force the horse to take it. The steps below work for any horse (even resistant horses). Repeat each step (not moving onto the next one) until the horse does it relaxed and thinking, instead of reacting:</p>
                            <p><b>1.</b> Approach and retreat placing your finger on the lips of your horse's mouth near their interdential gap.</p>
                            <p><b>2.</b> Approach and retreat placing your finger inside your horse's mouth at the interdential gap, touching the tounge.</p>
                            <p>Now we're repeating the steps above, but with the syringe instead of your finger.</p>
                            <p><b>3.</b> With de-wormer in hand (keep cap on the syringe), approach and retreat placing the syringe on the lips of your horse's mouth near their interdential gap.</p>
                            <p><b>4.</b> With de-wormer in hand (keep cap on the syringe), approach and retreat placing the syringe inside your horse's mouth at the interdential gap, touching the tounge.</p>
                            <p><b>5.</b> Remove cap from de-wormer syringe and slide it into the horse's interdential gap. Quickly squeeze desired de-wormer paste into the horse's mouth.</p>

                <h4>Object Desensitization vs. Location Desensitization</h4>
                <p>Which gets a queiter and relaxed horse quicker, desensitizing to objects or locations?</p>
                <p>Desensitizing a horse to a variety of objects is limited to the objects that are in your possesion while with the horse. Location desensitization gets horses quieter because not only does it make them relax with a new location, they also have to relax to the random and ever-changing objects that are in the location. This is why trail rides are so effective for getting horses calm in all sorts of situations. When on the trail, you get a horse desensitized to locations and objects, while the alternative only trains them to be comfortable with objects.</p>
                <p>Horses might be comfortale with a plastic bag in their stall, but then when they see a plastic bag on the sidewalk they are apprehensive about it again. This is because horses don't assume that because one plastic bag was safe, that all plasitc bags will be safe. They will be apprehensive to a familiar object, if the location of it is new. Desensitizing horses to objects can prove to be a waste of time, if they aren't also being desensistized to locations just as much.</p>
                <h4>Teaching Horses To Think About Scary Objects, Instead Of Repatitiously Proving That The Object Won't Hurt Them</h4>
                <p>Many horses don't know how to think about if something should be scary or if it is safe. Most horses just assume that the object isn't safe, if they haven't had high amounts of safe exposure to that type of object. This is why it is important that horses don't experience high amounts of stress and pressure every time they are getting trained. A good trainer will only stress and pressure their horse about once every two weeks. This will re-affirm the horse's emotions to stay stable and not escalate at every new form of pressure. This also fosters an environment where horses enjoy being and are relaxed during the learning process. If a person is pushing a horse to do high levels of performance every day, then that horse isn't going to like being around that person. My horses learn to think about new experiences instead of reacting. There is a clear difference between my horse and one that was started by another trainer, because mine won't spook or over react to a scary dog, rope being thrown, car driving by, or crossing a scary bridge. This is because my horses have learned to think about things instead of just react.</p>

            <div id="startEndLightDiv">
                <h4>Starting and Ending Light In Everything You Do</h4>
                <p>On the first day and last day of every week, I have a training session with my horses that has a very easy expectation and low stress level. The days in-between (Tuesday-Thursday) are days that I set expectations higher. Here's an example: I never pick up horses feet for the first time on a Monday or a Friday, because if the horse has a stressful time, it will start to resent it's decision to be around me. I will instead wait for a day between Tuesday-Thursday to do it for the first time.</p>
                <p> Another way I start and end light is by always spending 10-15 minutes at the beginning and end of every training session having my horses walk, and desensitizing my horses. Another way I start and end light, is I always ask with the lightest possible pressure when teaching horses an exercise and increase the pressure until my horses are motivated to look for the release of pressure. Once my horses are motivated to look for the release of pressure, I lower my pressure back to as light as possible as long as they keep staying motivated to find the release.</p>

                <p>Horses ruminate on things. We all know the famous saying, "Horses learn from the release of pressure.". Whatever the last thing they were thinking about when you put them away, is going to be thought about constantly until you catch them again. You can use this to your advantage if you control the last thing your horses are thinking about whenever you put them back in their stall. This is very impactful on their training. If you think that the only time horses are learning is while thier in the arena, under the saddle, or tied up, you're wrong. Horses that are put away, thinking about being relaxed and respectful will want to be caught whenever you catch them next. Horses that are put away thinking that they don't want to be submissive, will be more difficult to catch the next time. Starting and ending light is the key to having your horse enjoy the learning process.</p>
                <p>Having a horse that is relaxed and enjoying it's job and learning process brings better results than what you would get if you had intense training sessions on Mondays and Fridays. If you are working horses every day, during the last 30 minutes activly be with your horse (sitting next to it, brusing it, letting it eat, etc.) anything that keeps their attention relatively on you, but is enjoyable for them. Then when you put them away for the night, they will have more stress free experiences to ruminate on, rather than the hard work. This will allow the horse to enjoy being caught continually. If you don't do this you will find that a daily work schedule starts to make them resent being with you. If you only work and train your horses once a week, you will also need to do the 30 minutes of relaxing but attentive time (mentioned above) at the end of every session to keep horses wanting to be with you.</p>

                <h4>Training Abused Horses</h4>
                <p>I have found that abused horses only need to be re-taught two things. This article explains these two two ways of thinking that horses have to re-adapt. After these two lessons, all abused horses are ready to make progress in training.</p>

                <h4>Lesson 1: Understand Pressure</h4>
                <p>Horses that have been abused are often used to people escalating pressure with no chance for the horse to try to find the release of pressure. For example, someone could be standing by their horse (let's say that pressure has a scale of 1-10) with a pressure of 0, and the horse pushes the person with their head. An abusive person adds pressure that is so intese and high with a pressure of 9 or 10 to get the horse to stop pushing them with their head. Horses don't know how to deal with this type of abusive communication because horses never jump from a 0 to a 10 with one another in their herds. They always increase their pressure through each number, to give the other horse a fair warning to start looking for the release of pressure. Horses increase pressure gradually with ourward signs like: Swishing tail (1-2), pinning ears (3-4), biting (5-6), pushing with butt (7-8), 9(single leg kicks), 10(kicking with both rear legs). They never skip these steps, so they have an impossible time understanding humans that do skip steps.</p>

                <p>When training an abused horse, the first 3-4 days are to teach the horse that humans do use gradual amounts of pressure, and that we will give time for them to think through a problem and find the release of pressure. Some horses that have been abused either act out in defence when humans are not doing anything threatening, because the horse is scared that we are going to be unrational with our pressure. Some abused horses lock up and ignore the pressure that a human is giving them, because they know that if they move at all, they might get hurt from the owner. These problems are easily trained out of abused horses, and don't effect their training or life permenantly.</p> 
                
                <h4>Lesson 2: Relaxful mind</h4>
                <p>Horses that have been abused, haven't learned to be relaxed. They also haven't learned to think through pressure while being relaxed. Once a horse has learned to be relaxed while thinking through problems, it will no longer show the previously extreme reactions to being trained or taught. This relaxful mindset takes a lot of time to teach an abused horse. It takes somewhere between 4 weeks to 4 months depending on the amount of times the horse has been abused.</p>

                <h4>Something Every Horse Trainer Needs</h4>
                <p>Every horse trainer needs to have mastered at least one exercise that they know how to teach any type of horse, no matter what kind of reaction the horse gives.</p>
                <p>Any horse can be trained, and any exercise can be taught. The trainer just needs to have mastered the exercise if they want to be able to teach it to every horse.</p>
                <p>It is important for the first exercise that you teach a colt, to be done to the very best of the horse's ability. For example, if you teach it to round pen as your first exercise, you should be able to get that horse to do everything that a horse you've owned for two years can do. If you grade your horse's performance with the standard A, B, C, D, F grading system, you want your first exercise to be done to an A efficincy. Most colt starters don't do this, because they know that if the horse just understands the concept (lets say its a B) then they will be safe to move to the next exercise. This is true for most exercises, but it is a mistake to make with the first exercise taught. The first exercise is a time to set all clear boundaries with a horse, and to see if it can mentally and physically work hard. If the horse can't do an A amount of work 
                mentally or physically, then it would be important to inform the owner sooner rather than later.</p>
